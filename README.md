Scripts used in our paper "European plants lagging behind climate change pay a climatic debt in the North, but are favored in the South".

Scripts are numbered in the order they should be used.

Data have been downloaded using the first script, but because new data are uploaded to the GBIF every time, to be sure to get the same dataset, they should be downloaded from DOI provided in supplementary methods.

Otherwise, all other files needed, as well as intermediate files generated by R scripts are available here: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4550500
To know how files are generated follow the R script execution in the order indicated.
